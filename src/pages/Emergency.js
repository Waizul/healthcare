				EMS is an intricate system, and each component of this system
				has an essential role to perform as part of a coordinated and
				seamless system of emergency medical care. An EMS system
				comprises the following components: Agencies and organizations
				Communications and transportation networks Trauma systems,
				hospitals, trauma centers, and specialty care centers
				Rehabilitation facilities Highly trained professionals,
				including: volunteer and career pre-hospital personnel,
				physicians, nurses, therapists, administrators and government
				officials An informed public that knows what to do in a medical
				emergency EMS does not exist in isolation, but is integrated
				with other services and systems intended to maintain and enhance
				the communityâ€™s health and safety. EMS operates at the
				crossroads between health care, public health and public safety.
				A combination of the principles and resources of each is
				employed in EMS systems. Since EMS providers work in the
				community, they are often the first to identify public health
				problems and issues. The emergence of significant health
				problems is often heralded by its arrival in the Emergency
				Department and it arrives via EMS. Since EMS providers respond
				to all kinds of emergencies and all kinds of hazards, they often
				work shoulder-to-shoulder with public safety colleagues in law
				enforcement and fire services. But their primary mission is
				emergency medical care.
